## HTML Learning Schedule

### Day 3: Introduction to HTML

**Exercise 1: Understanding Basic HTML Structure**
Create a basic HTML document structure, which includes a doctype declaration, html, head, and body tags in an HTML file named index.html.

**Exercise 2: Working with Headings and Paragraphs**
Inside the body of index.html, use `<h1>` through `<h6>` tags to create headings. Add a couple of paragraphs about yourself using the `<p>` tags


### Day 4: Links, Images, and Lists

**Exercise 3: Creating Links**
Create a link to your favorite website using the `<a>` tag.

**Exercise 4: Adding Images**
Use the `<img>` tag to add an image to your site. You can use a personal photo, a favorite image, or a placeholder image.

**Exercise 5: Making Lists**
List your favorite books, movies, or hobbies using both unordered (`<ul>`) and ordered (`<ol>`) lists.

### Day 5: Tables and Forms

**Exercise 6: Creating Tables**
Create a table (`<table>`) that represents a simple weekly schedule. Use `<tr>` for rows, `<th>` for headers, and `<td>` for data.

**Exercise 7: Building Forms**
Build a contact form using the `<form>` tag. Include fields for name and email using the `<input>` tag and a message field using the `<textarea>` tag.

### Day 6-7: Building Multiple Pages and Final Project

**Exercise 8: Creating Multiple Pages**
Create two new HTML files named about.html and contact.html. Write some information about yourself in about.html. Include the contact form you made in contact.html.

**Exercise 9: Linking Between Pages**
In index.html, create a navigation bar using a list (`<ul>` or `<ol>`). Each list item (`<li>`) should contain a link (`<a>`) to one of the other pages (about.html and contact.html).

**Final Project: Personal Website**
Build a personal website with multiple pages. The home page (index.html) should have headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists. The about page (about.html) should have more information about you. The contact page (contact.html) should include a form for visitors to get in touch.
