HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language for the development of Web Pages.
As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.

Markup languages use sets of markup tags to characterize text elements within a document, which gives instructions to web browsers on how the document should appear.

HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. It provides a faster and more robust approach to web development with new page structure elements such as <main>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>and<nav></nav>

Tags
HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of markup tags. These markup tags are the fundamental characteristic of HTML. Every markup tag is composed of a keyword, surrounded by angle brackets, such as <html>, <head>, <p>, and so on.

HTML tags normally come in pairs like <html> and </html>. The first tag in a pair is often called the opening tag (or start tag), and the second tag is 
called the closing tag.

An opening tag and a closing tag are identical, except for the slash / after the opening angle bracket of the closing tag, to tell the browser that the command has been completed.

An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts:
Head - contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, the title of the page, version of HTML, Meta Data, etc.

Body - contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.
